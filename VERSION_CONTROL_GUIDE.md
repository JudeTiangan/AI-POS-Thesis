## 🚀 **How to Return to This Checkpoint**

If you need to restore your project to this exact state:

```powershell
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "C:\Users\Jude\Desktop\Thesis-AI-POS"

# See all available checkpoints
git --no-pager tag -l

# Return to Milestone 1 checkpoint
git checkout v1.0-milestone1

# Or return to latest version
git checkout master
```

---

## 💾 **How to Create New Checkpoints**

When you make significant changes and want to save a new checkpoint:

```powershell
# 1. Add your changes
git add .

# 2. Create a commit
git commit -m "Your description of changes"

# 3. Create a new tag (optional but recommended)
git tag -a v1.1-new-feature -m "Description of this version"
```

---

## 🔍 **Useful Commands**

### **Check Current Status**
```powershell
git status                    # See what files have changed
git --no-pager log --oneline -5   # See last 5 commits
git --no-pager tag -l         # List all checkpoints
```

### **Compare Versions**
```powershell
git --no-pager diff           # See current changes
git --no-pager show v1.0-milestone1  # See what's in a checkpoint
```

### **Backup Management**
```powershell
git stash                     # Temporarily save current changes
git stash pop                 # Restore temporarily saved changes
```

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

1. **Always commit before major changes**: Create checkpoints before trying new features
2. **Use descriptive messages**: Make your commit messages clear and detailed
3. **Test before committing**: Make sure your app works before creating checkpoints
4. **Keep checkpoints small**: Don't wait too long between saves

## 🆘 **Emergency Recovery**

If something goes wrong and you need to completely reset:

```powershell
# Return to the last working checkpoint
git reset --hard v1.0-milestone1

# Or return to the latest commit
git reset --hard HEAD
```

**⚠️ Warning**: `--hard` will delete any uncommitted changes!

4. **Documentation**: Update your documentation with each checkpoint
