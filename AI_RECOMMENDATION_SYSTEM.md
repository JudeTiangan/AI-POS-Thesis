## 🎯 **Core AI Algorithms Implemented**

### 1. **Market Basket Analysis (Association Rule Mining)**
- **Algorithm**: Apriori-based association rules
- **Purpose**: Discovers items frequently bought together
- **Metrics Used**:
  - **Support**: How often items appear together
  - **Confidence**: Likelihood of buying Y when buying X  
  - **Lift**: How much more likely than random chance
- **Weight in Final Score**: 35%
- **Example**: "Coffee" → "Sugar" (Confidence: 85%, Support: 40%, Lift: 2.1)

### 2. **Customer Behavior Analytics**
- **Algorithm**: Personal purchase pattern analysis
- **Purpose**: Recommends based on individual customer history
- **Factors Analyzed**:
  - **Purchase Frequency**: How often customer buys specific items
  - **Recency**: Time since last similar purchase
  - **Category Preferences**: Favorite product categories
- **Weight in Final Score**: 25%

### 3. **Collaborative Filtering**
- **Algorithm**: Customer similarity using Cosine Similarity
- **Purpose**: "Customers like you also bought" recommendations
- **Method**: 
  - Calculate similarity between customers based on purchase vectors
  - Weight recommendations by similar customers' preferences
- **Weight in Final Score**: 20%

### 4. **Trend Analysis**
- **Algorithm**: Time-series analysis of item popularity
- **Purpose**: Identify trending/popular items
- **Calculation**: Week-over-week purchase growth rates
- **Weight in Final Score**: 10%

### 5. **Category Preference Scoring**
- **Algorithm**: Preference learning based on purchase history
- **Purpose**: Recommend items from preferred categories
- **Weight in Final Score**: 10%

## 📈 **Data Models**

### Customer Analytics Model
```dart
class CustomerAnalytics {
  String customerId;
  Map<String, int> itemPurchaseFrequency;     // Item ID → Purchase count
  List<Purchase> purchaseHistory;             // Complete transaction history
  Map<String, double> categoryPreferences;    // Category ID → Preference score
  DateTime lastPurchase;                      // Last transaction date
  double averageOrderValue;                   // AOV calculation
  int totalOrders;                           // Total number of orders
  List<String> frequentItems;                // Top 5 most purchased items
  Map<String, List<String>> associationRules; // Item → Associated items
}
```

### Association Rule Model
```dart
class AssociationRule {
  String antecedent;      // If customer buys this
  String consequent;      // They also buy this  
  double confidence;      // How often this rule is true (0-1)
  double support;         // How often both items appear together (0-1)
  double lift;           // How much more likely than random (>1 = positive)
}
```

## 🎯 **Algorithm Implementation Details**

### Market Basket Analysis Calculation
```javascript
// Confidence: P(B|A) = P(A ∩ B) / P(A)
function calculateConfidence(antecedent, consequent, transactions) {
  let antecedentCount = 0;
  let bothCount = 0;
  
  transactions.forEach(transaction => {
    const hasAntecedent = antecedent.every(item => transaction.includes(item));
    if (hasAntecedent) {
      antecedentCount++;
      if (transaction.includes(consequent)) {
        bothCount++;
      }
    }
  });
  
  return antecedentCount > 0 ? bothCount / antecedentCount : 0.0;
}

// Support: P(A ∩ B) = |A ∩ B| / |Total Transactions|
function calculateSupport(itemset, transactions) {
  let count = 0;
  transactions.forEach(transaction => {
    if (itemset.every(item => transaction.includes(item))) {
      count++;
    }
  });
  return count / transactions.length;
}

// Lift: Confidence(A → B) / Support(B)
function calculateLift(antecedent, consequent, transactions) {
  const confidence = calculateConfidence(antecedent, consequent, transactions);
  const consequentSupport = calculateSupport([consequent], transactions);
  return consequentSupport > 0 ? confidence / consequentSupport : 0.0;
}
```

### Customer Similarity (Collaborative Filtering)
```dart
// Cosine Similarity between two customers
double calculateCustomerSimilarity(CustomerAnalytics customer1, CustomerAnalytics customer2) {
  final items1 = customer1.itemPurchaseFrequency;
  final items2 = customer2.itemPurchaseFrequency;
  
  final commonItems = items1.keys.toSet().intersection(items2.keys.toSet());
  if (commonItems.isEmpty) return 0.0;

  double dotProduct = 0.0;
  double norm1 = 0.0;
  double norm2 = 0.0;

  for (final item in commonItems) {
    final freq1 = items1[item]!.toDouble();
    final freq2 = items2[item]!.toDouble();
    
    dotProduct += freq1 * freq2;
    norm1 += freq1 * freq1;
    norm2 += freq2 * freq2;
  }

  final magnitude = sqrt(norm1) * sqrt(norm2);
  return magnitude > 0 ? dotProduct / magnitude : 0.0;
}
```

### Final Recommendation Score Calculation
```dart
// Weighted combination of all algorithms
double totalScore = 0.0;
totalScore += associationScore * 0.35;        // 35% Market Basket Analysis
totalScore += behaviorScore * 0.25;           // 25% Customer Behavior  
totalScore += collaborativeScore * 0.20;      // 20% Collaborative Filtering
totalScore += trendScore * 0.10;              // 10% Trend Analysis
totalScore += categoryScore * 0.10;           // 10% Category Preferences
```
